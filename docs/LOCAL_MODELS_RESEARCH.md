# Local Model Research

## Objective
Identify best-in-class local models for:
1. **Audio Transcription** (speech-to-text)
2. **Cognitive Processing** (Q&A, reasoning, insights)

Target: Models that run efficiently on consumer GPU (RTX 3060+, 24GB VRAM typical)

## Current Candidates (January 2025)

### Audio Transcription

| Model | Provider | Size | Notes | Status |
|-------|----------|------|-------|--------|
| Whisper Large v3 | OpenAI | ~3GB | Industry standard, good accuracy | Baseline |
| faster-whisper | Systran | Same | Optimized Whisper, 4x faster | **Recommended** |
| distil-whisper | HuggingFace | ~1.5GB | 6x faster, slight accuracy loss | Consider |
| Moonshine | UsefulSensors | ~200MB | Ultra-fast, embedded-focused | Research |

**TODO:** Research newer 2025 models:
- [ ] Check HuggingFace trending audio models
- [ ] Look for fine-tuned Whisper variants
- [ ] Investigate NVIDIA NeMo ASR models
- [ ] Check if Gemma has audio capabilities
- [ ] Look at Meta's SeamlessM4T v2

### Cognitive Processing (LLMs)

| Model | Provider | Size | Context | Notes | Status |
|-------|----------|------|---------|-------|--------|
| Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct | Alibaba | 14B | 32K | Excellent reasoning, multilingual | Suggested |
| Llama 3.1 8B Instruct | Meta | 8B | 128K | Very long context | Consider |
| Mistral 7B v0.3 | Mistral | 7B | 32K | Fast, good quality | Baseline |
| DeepSeek-V2 Lite | DeepSeek | 16B | 32K | Strong reasoning | Research |
| Phi-3 Medium | Microsoft | 14B | 128K | Efficient, good quality | Consider |

**TODO:** Research 2025 updates:
- [ ] Check if Qwen3 has been released
- [ ] Look for Llama 3.2/3.3 updates
- [ ] Investigate Gemma 2 capabilities
- [ ] Check DeepSeek V3 if available
- [ ] Look at Mistral updates
- [ ] Research Command R+ local deployment

## Evaluation Criteria

### Transcription Models
- **Accuracy:** WER (Word Error Rate) on benchmark datasets
- **Speed:** Real-time factor (RTF) on target GPU
- **Language Support:** English + others
- **Noise Robustness:** Performance in realistic conditions
- **VRAM Usage:** Must fit in budget

### Cognitive Models
- **Reasoning Quality:** Complex question answering
- **Context Handling:** Long-form transcripts
- **Speed:** Tokens/second on target GPU
- **VRAM Efficiency:** 14B models should fit in 16-24GB
- **Instruction Following:** Structured output generation

## Benchmarking Plan

### Phase 1: Model Survey
1. Review latest papers and releases (Jan 2025)
2. Check model cards and demos
3. Filter by hardware requirements
4. Create shortlist (3-5 per category)

### Phase 2: Local Testing
1. Set up inference environment (vllm, llama.cpp, etc.)
2. Run standard benchmarks
3. Test with real meeting audio samples
4. Measure latency and resource usage

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Pick winners for each category
2. Build backend adapters
3. Performance tuning
4. Documentation

## Hardware Considerations

**Minimum:**
- GPU: RTX 3060 (12GB VRAM)
- RAM: 16GB system RAM
- Storage: NVMe SSD recommended

**Recommended:**
- GPU: RTX 4070+ (16-24GB VRAM)
- RAM: 32GB system RAM
- Storage: Fast NVMe for model loading

**Optimal:**
- GPU: RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) or A6000 (48GB)
- RAM: 64GB system RAM
- Multi-GPU: Consider for separate transcription + cognitive

## Inference Frameworks

| Framework | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|----------|------|------|
| vllm | LLM serving | Fast, good batching | LLM-only |
| llama.cpp | CPU/GPU hybrid | Flexible, quantization | Slower than GPU-only |
| faster-whisper | Whisper models | 4x speedup over base | Whisper-specific |
| CTranslate2 | General transcription | Fast, multi-backend | Setup complexity |
| TensorRT-LLM | Maximum speed | NVIDIA optimized | Complex setup |

**Recommendation:**
- Transcription: `faster-whisper` (simple, fast)
- LLM: `vllm` or `llama.cpp` depending on quantization needs

## Cost Analysis

**Cloud (Current Gemini):**
- Transcription: ~$0.006/minute (GPT-4o pricing)
- Cognitive: ~$0.075/1K tokens input, ~$0.30/1K tokens output
- **Monthly (20 hours meetings):** ~$50-100 depending on usage

**Local (One-time setup):**
- GPU: $400-1500 (if not already owned)
- Electricity: ~$0.20/kWh Ã— 0.3kW = $0.06/hour
- **Monthly (20 hours):** ~$1-2 electricity only
- **ROI:** 5-15 months depending on usage

**Privacy Benefit:** Priceless for sensitive discussions
